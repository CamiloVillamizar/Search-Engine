# Search-Engine
Final Project for my Data Structures class

This Search Engine parses .psv files into question objects and loads the information into a polymorphic structure class. Then the user may enter their query or specific keywords at the beginning of the query to specify how it should work. OR combines results for each word within the query, and AND returns results only showing up in all the words. Additionally, the user may enter the keyword NOT to remove the results from any words coming after the keyword, from the results preceding it. The results are then sorted on relevancy to the user's query and displayed.
